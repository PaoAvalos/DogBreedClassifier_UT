# DogBreedClassifier_UT

Hi! Welcome to the Project C9: Dog Breed Classifier!

This repository contains this README.md,  Report and two worked notebooks.

The main notebook is called "Main Notebook. Model 1 and 2.ipynb".
The additional notebook used for the visualisation for poster and training the Model 3 is called "Additional Notebook for Poster and Model 3.ipynb".

In order to run our code(both notebooks) you need to install Tensorflow and all other libraries that are imported in the beginning of the notebooks, also download train images and labels from KAGGLE (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification).

First thing we do after importing all of the libraries is loading data and preparing it for fitting into the model. 
We used Sequential model (Keras) with imported layers of pre-trained model MobileResV2, Resnet50. 
In the end of the main notebook, you can see the visualization of the predicted labels. The picture of a dog with correctly predicted label has a green frame and the wrong one has a red frame with the correct answer shown in brackets.

Main notebook has the all descriptions, analysis, results, conclusion,and references. We have applied confusion matrix and classficiation report, visualised accuracy and loss curves to better understand and interpret the result of the classfication models.

Enjoy your time reading our notebooks!
